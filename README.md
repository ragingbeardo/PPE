# Poor Planner's Escape

Don't leave your hideout without some PPE for safety.

Simple mod with only one config option, an on/off switch called `shutErDown` found in the `config/` folder of this mod. The file is called `config.jsonc`.

If you ever end a PMC raid in SPTarkov with a `leave` status (disconnecting from the escape menu), this will override that to be a `runner` status. You will keep whatever you are carrying but you will not maintain `FIR` status on your items.

# Installation

1. Download the .7z file from the latest release
2. Copy the user folder from inside the archive into your SPT Directory
3. Profit
